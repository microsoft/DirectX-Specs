This repository publishes the engineering specs for a number of DirectX features.
It supplements the [official API documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/directx)
with an extra level of detail that can be useful to expert developers.

Note that some of this material (especially in older specs) may not have been kept up to 
date with changes that occurred since the spec was written.

These specs are presented with different interfaces at two different URLs:
* To read the specs, use [https://microsoft.github.io/DirectX-Specs](https://microsoft.github.io/DirectX-Specs)
* To view history, clone, file an issue or prepare a pull request, use [https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectX-Specs](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectX-Specs)

Make sure that you visit the [DirectX Landing Page](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/landing-page/) for more resources for DirectX developers.

_These D3D12 specs were written as incremental deltas, with a separate spec per feature area.
Baseline information about rendering pipeline behaviors that are common between D3D11 and D3D12
was inherited from the D3D11 spec rather than being duplicated into the 12 documentation.
We have an ambition of refactoring this material to present more of a unified how-things-are-now
view, rather than a historical what-changed-to-get-here, and to merge in foundational
information from the D3D11 spec. Contributions welcome if you'd like to help with that!_

_This is not yet a complete set of D3D12 specs: we'll be adding more as time permits.
Please let us know if there are particular areas you'd like to see prioritized._

## Direct3D 11

[Direct3D 11.3 Functional Specification](d3d/archive/D3D11_3_FunctionalSpec.htm)

_This is a single combined spec, covering all functionality of D3D versions from 10 to 11.3._
