# ID3D12CommandQueue Dynamic Priority

## Introduction

Currently in `ID3D12Device::CreateCommandQueue` parameters, `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_DESC.Priority` allows setting the `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PRIORITY` that the created queue object will have for its entire lifetime, but that priority cannot be adjusted dynamically. In the existing API `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PRIORITY_NORMAL` and `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH` correspond to process priorities, and `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PRIORITY_GLOBAL_REALTIME` corresponds to global priority.

> **Note that this feature is disabled when DIRECT or COMPUTE queues are grouped in Scheduling Groups, and in that case the creation priority parameter is ignored.** This must be kept this way for app-compat, but the new APIs in this spec would allow creation of such queue types with new defined flags that will not ignore the creation parameter priority.

There are certain scenarios where the apps calling into D3D12 needs to _dynamically_ adjust the priorities on specific command queues. This spec states the necessary changes to the D3D12 runtime to allow such command queue dynamic global/process priority setting. No driver changes are involved.

## Scheduling groups and command queues

### Exposing new information to apps

Introducing a new `CheckFeatureSupport` cap `D3D12_FEATURE_HARDWARE_SCHEDULING_QUEUE_GROUPINGS` with associated data structure `D3D12_FEATURE_DATA_HARDWARE_SCHEDULING_QUEUE_GROUPINGS`.

```C++
typedef struct D3D12_FEATURE_DATA_HARDWARE_SCHEDULING_QUEUE_GROUPINGS
{
    [annotation("_Out_")] UINT ComputeQueuesPer3DQueue;
} D3D12_FEATURE_DATA_HARDWARE_SCHEDULING_QUEUE_GROUPINGS;
```

*ComputeQueuesPer3DQueue*

When reported as greater than zero, indicates the maximum number of `COMPUTE` command queues (with the same `CreatorID`) can be grouped together with a `DIRECT` queue in the same scheduling group.

When reported as zero, means that scheduling groups do not group more than one queue.

### Intro to grouping algorithm

When hardware scheduling is enabled and `ID3D12CommandQueue` of `DIRECT` or `COMPUTE` type objects are created, they are grouped into a scheduling group that shares their engine `NodeIndex` and `CreatorID`.

The scheduling groups can hold up to 1 `DIRECT` queue and up to `ComputeQueuesPer3DQueue` compute queues, before they become full. Once they are full, a new scheduling group is created as the next queue of these types is created. 

At queue creation, the runtime looks for a non-full scheduling group from the first to the last existing scheduling groups in creation order to associate the new queue with, or creates a new one if no suitable scheduling group was found.

Deleting a command queue that was associated to a scheduling group will open up a spot in an otherwise possibly full scheduling group, and the next queue created will be able to take up this spot and prevent creation of a new scheduling group if no other spots were available.

### Relation to dynamic priorities feature

Given that priorities apply to scheduling groups (as opposed to applying to individual command queues), we need to first extend the _command queue to scheduling group_ mapping algorithm at queue creation, using new `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_FLAGS`, to allow for apps to opt-in to new grouping modes when dynamic priority adjustement is enabled.

If the app doesn't opt-in explicitly when creating a queue with the new defined flags, the scheduling group to queue grouping algorithm remains unchanged, and queues created without them cannot adjust their priority dynamically. Any priority specification (either at queue creation or dynamically adjusted) of queues created with the new flags defined in `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_FLAGS` does not affect the priorities of any other queues created without the flags, to maintain app compat.

## STRUCT: D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_FLAGS

```C++
typedef enum D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_FLAGS
{
  // ... new flags ...
  D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_FLAG_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_PRIORITY = ...,
} D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_FLAGS;
```

*D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_FLAG_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_PRIORITY*

If set, indicates that the runtime will allow dynamically adjusting the priority of the underlying scheduling group associated with this command queue. Altering the priority of this queue or any other in the same scheduling group, affects the priority of all other queues in the scheduling group.

Furthermore, when creating a queue with this flag, the creation priority parameter overrides the priority of all other queues already associated to the same scheduling group.

If set, on command queue creation, the runtime will group this new command queue with scheduling groups with the same `CreatorID` **and that only contain other queues with this flag also set**. The latter restriction ensures that queues created without any of the new flags don't get their priorities affected by the usage of the new APIs.

> Note: In case apps want to create queues that can have their priorities dynamically adjusted without altering other queues in the same scheduling group, they can use the existing `CreatorID` API with a unique `CreatorID` to keep the queue associated 1:1 with a scheduling group.

## Command queue priorities

### Queue creation priority assignment

On command queue creation, `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PRIORITY` (passed in `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_DESC.Priority`) determines the initial command queue priority relative to other contexts within the same process, or for global realtime, relative to other apps in the system.

### Dynamic queue priority adjustment

Two kinds of orthogonal priority settings can be dynamically adjusted on command queues after creation:

- `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY` specifies a priority relative to other apps in the system.

- `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PROCESS_PRIORITY` specifies a non-yielding boost relative to other contexts within the same process.

### Mapping table: D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PRIORITY - D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY/D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PROCESS_PRIORITY

The value of `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_DESC.Priority` at creation will map to default values for `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PROCESS_PRIORITY` and `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY`.

When the app aims to dynamically set a priority to match a definition of `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PRIORITY`, the app must set the `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY` and/or `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PROCESS_PRIORITY` values to the corresponding values in the table (e.g reverse mapping lookup).

Note that the app has more flexibility when adjusting `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PROCESS_PRIORITY` and `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY` dynamically to configure new combinations not expressed by `D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_PRIORITY` at creation.
